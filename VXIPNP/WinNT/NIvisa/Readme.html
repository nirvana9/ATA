<h3><a name="INSTALLING_AND_UNINSTALLING_NI-VISA_5.0.2" id="INSTALLING_AND_UNINSTALLING_NI-VISA_5.0.2">Installing and Uninstalling NI-VISA 5.0.2</a></h3>
<p class="Indent1">NI-VISA 5.0.2 does not support Windows 9<em>x</em>/NT/2000. To run your VISA application on Windows 95, you must install NI-VISA 2.6.1 or lower. To run your VISA application on Windows 98/Me, you must install NI-VISA 3.0.1 or lower. To run your VISA application on Windows NT, you must install NI-VISA 3.3.1 or lower. To run your VISA application on Windows 2000, you must install NI-VISA 4.6.2 or lower.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Before you install NI-VISA 5.0.2, we strongly recommend that you uninstall any versions of VISA prior to NI-VISA 2.0.1. NI-VISA 5.0.2 should upgrade properly over NI-VISA 2.0.1 through 4.6.2.</p>

<p class="Indent1">After uninstalling NI-VISA, some DLLs and executables may remain in the NI-VISA directories. To complete the uninstall process, you must restart your machine.</p>

<p class="Indent1"><strong>Note</strong>: The uninstaller application does not notify you when rebooting is necessary. If you plan to reinstall NI-VISA, you always should reboot the machine after running the uninstaller.</p>

<p class="Indent1">You can programmatically or &quot;silently&quot; install NI-VISA. You also can programmatically control which features of NI-VISA are enabled for installation, allowing you to install a subset of the NI-VISA feature list. Refer to the <span class="Monospace">spec.ini</span> file in the same directory as this readme for more information about installing NI-VISA programmatically and selecting which features to install.</p>

<h3><a name="LABWINDOWS_CVI_RUN-TIME_ENGINE" id="LABWINDOWS_CVI_RUN-TIME_ENGINE">LabWindows/CVI Run-Time Engine</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">The Setup program now automatically installs the LabWindows/CVI Run-Time Engine when necessary. The NI-VISA interactive utility, VISAIC, requires the LabWindows/CVI Run-Time Engine 8.0 or later to be installed. When you install this utility, Setup also installs the LabWindows/CVI Run-Time Engine if it is not already present.</p>

<h3><a name="PXI_SUPPORT" id="PXI_SUPPORT">PXI Support</a></h3>

<h4><a name="PXI_GEOGRAPHIC_ADDRESSING_SUPPORT" id="PXI_GEOGRAPHIC_ADDRESSING_SUPPORT">PXI Geographic Addressing Support</a></h4>

<p class="Indent4">Starting with NI-VISA 3.0, NI-VISA supports geographic addressing for PXI resources. Geographic addressing includes the ability to identify the chassis number and slot number for a PXI module. To support geographic
addressing, the following attributes have been implemented on the PXI INSTR resource type:</p>

<table cellspacing="12" class="Borderless"><tr><td><ul><li>
<span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_SLOT</span>&#8212;specifies the PXI slot number for instrument.
</li>
<li>
<span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_PXI_CHASSIS</span>&#8212;specifies the PXI chassis number for the instrument.
</li></ul></td></tr></table>

<p class="Indent4">Using these attributes, PXI resources can be located based on their geographic address in a system. For example, you can use the resource description string <span class="Monospace">&quot;PXI?*INSTR{VI_ATTR_PXI_CHASSIS==1 &amp;&amp; VI_ATTR_SLOT==3}&quot;</span> to locate a PXI device in chassis 1, slot 3.</p>

<h4><a name="PXI_RESOURCE_NAMING" id="PXI_RESOURCE_NAMING">PXI Resource Naming</a></h4>

<p class="Indent2">Starting with NI-VISA 3.0, NI-VISA includes a new PXI resource format based on the traditional bus number/device number/function number addressing scheme:</p>

<p class="Indent2"><span class="Monospace">PXI0::&lt;busNum&gt;-&lt;devNum&gt;[.&lt;funcNum&gt;]::INSTR</span></p>

<p class="Indent2">For example, given a PXI device at bus 2, device number 17, function number 1, the corresponding resource name for this device would be <span class="Monospace">PXI0::2-17.1::INSTR</span>.</p>

<p class="Indent2">In this new resource name, the <span class="Monospace">0</span> in <span class="Monospace">PXI0</span> represents the PCI interface number for the PXI system. Currently, this interface number is always <span class="Monospace">0</span>. Note that the interface number is not necessarily the same as a device's PCI bus number.</p>

<p class="Indent2">Of course, NI-VISA continues to support the legacy PXI naming convention:</p>

<p class="Indent2"><span class="Monospace">PXI&lt;busNum&gt;::&lt;devNum&gt;[::funcNum]::INSTR</span></p>

<p class="Indent2">Note that for a single-function PXI device on PCI bus 0, both of these resource formats yield an identical string.</p>

<h4><a name="PXI_SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION" id="PXI_SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION">PXI System Configuration</a></h4>

<p class="Indent2">To enable geographic addressing, a PXI system description file
(<span class="Monospace">pxisys.ini</span>) must be present on the system. Beginning with NI-VISA 3.0, Measurement &amp; Automation Explorer (MAX) includes the ability to identify components in a PXI system. Through the hardware identification process, MAX collects the information necessary to generate a PXI system description file.</p>

<p class="Indent2">Follow these steps to configure your PXI system for geographic addressing:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Launch MAX.
</li>
<li>
Expand the <strong>Devices and Interfaces</strong> folder. If you are configuring a LabVIEW RT system, locate that system's <strong>Devices and Interfaces</strong> folder under the <strong>Remote Systems</strong> view.
</li>
<li>
Identify your PXI controller. Locate the <strong>PXI System 0</strong> item. <strong>PXI System 0</strong> represents the PXI system and its controller. To identify this controller, right-click on <strong>PXI System 0</strong> and use the <strong>Identify As</strong> feature, selecting your controller from the resulting list.
<p class="Body"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using an external PC to control the PXI system via a PXI bridge such as MXI-3, select this option from the menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
Identify your PXI chassis. Expand the <strong>PXI System 0</strong> view to locate your PXI chassis in the system. For embedded controllers, a chassis is added when the controller has been identified. For a chassis controlled via MXI-3, these chassis are added automatically by the software. To identify a chassis, right-click on the chassis and use the <strong>Identify As</strong> feature, selecting your chassis from the resulting list. The chassis is assigned a number based on the PCI bus number that the chassis resides on.
</li></ol>

<p class="Indent2">Once the controller and chassis have been identified, a <span class="Monospace">pxisys.ini</span> file is created. This file conforms to the PXI specification and allows drivers (including NI-VISA) and other configuration software to enable geographic addressing and other features of PXI. On Windows, this file is in the <span class="Monospace">Windows</span> directory. For LabVIEW RT systems, the <span class="Monospace">pxisys.ini</span> file
is automatically copied to the remote system's <span class="Monospace">c:\ni-rt\system</span> directory.</p>

<h3><a name="SUPPORT_FOR_AGILENT_HP_CONTROLLERS" id="SUPPORT_FOR_AGILENT_HP_CONTROLLERS">Agilent/HP Controller Support</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">NI-VISA now works with Agilent/HP GPIB and VXI controller cards. To use this feature, go into MAX, select <strong>Tools&#0187;NI-VISA&#0187;VISA Options</strong>, choose the <strong>Passports</strong> tab, and enable the <span class="Monospace">NiVisaTulip.dll</span> Passport. NI-VISA automatically finds and accesses any GPIB or VXI devices. However, NI-VISA does not configure the Agilent/HP hardware; you still must do that with the Agilent/HP I/O Config utility.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you have both National Instruments and Agilent/HP controllers in the same system, you must configure the cards at different system addresses, such as GPIB0 and GPIB1. If both vendors try to use the same interface address, NI-VISA reports an error from <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> or VISA Find Resources.</p>

<h3><a name="USING_viPeekXX_viPokeXX_MACROS" id="USING_viPeekXX_viPokeXX_MACROS">Using viPeekXX/viPokeXX Macros</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">Users who want to use the <span class="Monospace">viPeekXX</span>/<span class="Monospace">viPokeXX</span> macros for platforms on which the macros are available must define a macro called <span class="Monospace">NIVISA_PEEKPOKE</span> before including <span class="Monospace">visa.h</span>. Note that the macros are currently available on only the Win32 platform (all C/C++ compilers).</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you have used these macros with a version of NI-VISA prior to 2.0, your application will continue to run, but the peek/poke performance decreases. You should relink with the libraries supplied with this installation to regain the prior peek/poke performance.</p>

<h3><a name="WHQL_SIGNING_USB_HARDWARE" id="WHQL_SIGNING_USB_HARDWARE">WHQL Signing USB Hardware</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">To WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) sign your USB hardware using the NI-VISA driver for Windows XP/2000, as part of this process you need a PDB (Program DataBase) file for the underlying driver (<span class="Monospace">NiViUsbK.sys</span>).</p>

<p class="Indent1"><span class="Monospace">NiViUsbK.pdb</span> is provided for this purpose. It is in <span class="Monospace-italic">&lt;NI-VISA Installation Directory&gt;</span><span class="Monospace">\WinNT\NIvisa\USB</span>. This is typically <span class="Monospace">C:\VXIPNP\WinNT\NIvisa\USB</span>.</p>

<h3><a name="CREATING_AND_DIGITALLY_SIGNING_CATALOG_FILES" id="CREATING_AND_DIGITALLY_SIGNING_CATALOG_FILES">Creating and Digitally Signing Catalog Files</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">On Windows Vista and Windows 7, if you generate an INF file using the NI-VISA Driver Wizard, the INF file installs correctly by itself. However, a warning dialog notifies you that Windows cannot verify the publisher of this driver software. To avoid this dialog, you must create and digitally sign a Windows Catalog (<span class="Monospace">.cat</span>) file.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For more information about creating and signing catalog files, Microsoft has a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/drvsign/kmcs_walkthrough.mspx">Kernel-Mode Code Signing Walkthrough</a> whitepaper that describes the details of this process. The generated catalog file should reference only the INF file.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="KNOWN_ISSUES" id="KNOWN_ISSUES">Known Issues</a></h2>

<p class="Body">If you are using interrupts with a PXI card that uses an NI-VISA-based driver on an NI RT Hypervisor system, independent reboot of the RT system might hang if the driver does not have the Interrupt Disarm sequence defined. Stop any VISA application on the RT system that might have enabled interrupts for such cards before attempting independent reboot of the RT system. Do a full system reboot if the RT system hangs.</p>

<p class="Body">IVI driver developers can use the new VISA COM API. NI-VISA does not yet document this API, so only those developers familiar with the specification should use it in this release. The relevant COM classes for getting started include IResourceManager and IVisaSession, registered in <span class="Monospace">GlobMgr.dll</span>. The VISA COM API is functionally equivalent to the VISA C API. It does not add features; it is just another language interface. You can install the VISA COM API only if you have Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher on your system.</p>

<p class="Body">If you are using NI-VISA with the VisaNS .NET API, you may find that an existing project created with an older version of VisaNS now produces build errors that read <span class="Monospace">error CS0011: Referenced class '&lt;className&gt;' has base class or interface 'NationalInstruments.ISynchronizeCallbacks' defined in an
	assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'NationalInstruments.Common'</span>. To eliminate this error, add a reference to the <span class="Monospace">NationalInstruments.Common</span> assembly to your project.</p>

<p class="Body">The NI-VISA Configuration component is not compatible with NI-RIO 2.1 and lower. The NI-VISA Installer shows a warning if the NI-VISA Configuration component is selected to be installed and NI-RIO 2.1 or lower currently is installed on the system.</p>

<p class="Body">If NI-VISA 4.2 or earlier is installed on a system with LabWindows/CVI 8.5 or later, and you then subsequently upgrade to NI-VISA 4.3 or later, the installer does not clean up some of the older files. In this installation scenario, to use the latest VISA API with LabWindows/CVI, you should manually remove the following files, after upgrading NI-VISA:</p>

<p class="Body"><span class="Monospace">C:\Program Files\National Instruments\CVI85\bin\visa.lfp<br>

<p class="Indent1">For Serial INSTR sessions, <span class="Monospace">viClear</span> previously would flush (discard) the I/O buffers and then send a break. According to the VISA spec, VISA must flush (discard) the I/O output buffer, send a break, and then flush (discard) the I/O input buffer. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1"><span class="Monospace">viScanf</span> and variants did not support the <span class="Monospace">%u</span> identifier for arrays. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1"><span class="Monospace">viPrintf</span> and variants did not support the <span class="Monospace">%zy</span> and <span class="Monospace">%Zy</span> identifiers for floating point data. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1"><span class="Monospace">viPrintf</span> and variants previously generated <span class="Monospace">NaN</span>, <span class="Monospace">+Inf</span>, and <span class="Monospace">-Inf</span>. It now generates <span class="Monospace">NAN</span>, <span class="Monospace">INF</span>, and <span class="Monospace">NINF</span>, respectively.</p>

<p class="Indent1"><span class="Monospace">viScanf</span> and variants did not correctly interpret the input values <span class="Monospace">NAN</span>, <span class="Monospace">INF</span>, and <span class="Monospace">NINF</span>. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Detecting a VXI-11 device without a name (IP address only) would crash MAX. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Reading PXI BAR addresses or the Model Name property from VISA would sometimes return incorrect values. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The function <span class="Monospace">viMapAddress</span> would hang when executed multiple times on PXI/PXI instruments when the CPU had hyperthreading enabled. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Remote VISA systems in MAX would use the IP address in cases where it should have used the hostname. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Guest users on Windows XP could not change VISA aliases. This is fixed.</p>

<h3><a name="NI-VISA_3.2_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES" id="NI-VISA_3.2_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES">NI-VISA 3.2</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">Enabling the NiVisaTulip Passport would cause applications to crash on exit. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a USB RAW resource, calling <span class="Monospace">viEnableEvent</span> on <span class="Monospace">VI_EVENT_USB_INTR</span> with the <span class="Monospace">VI_HNDLR</span> mechanism would cause a crash when the first interrupt arrived. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Added support in MAX for the standard Export and Import wizard. For NI-VISA, this allows you to transfer the VISA aliases and driver settings.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viPrintf</span> on a remote VISA session would return <span class="Monospace">VI_ERROR_IO</span> instead of <span class="Monospace">VI_ERROR_RSRC_LOCKED</span> when the remote resource was locked. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The VISA Interactive Control utility (VISAIC) now displays an error message box when <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> returns an error.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a PXI INSTR resource, calling <span class="Monospace">viDisableEvent</span> and then <span class="Monospace">viWaitOnEvent</span> would cause a crash. On Windows, the application would exit; on LabVIEW RT (both Phar Lap ETS and RTX), the system would need to be rebooted. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The NI-VISA COM API now supports PXI (INSTR, MEMACC) and USB (INSTR, RAW).</p>

<p class="Indent1">Right-clicking on a PXI chassis in MAX now provides the option to open a VISA session to that PXI BACKPLANE resource.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Fixed various issues in MAX related to changing the IP address of a remote VISA system.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viParseRsrcEx</span> would in some cases output the resource class using the same case you used in the resource string in the input parameter. The output parameter should always be uppercase. This is fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, calling <span class="Monospace">viGetAttribute</span> on <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_ASRL_WIRE_MODE</span> would always output <span class="Monospace">-1</span> if you had not yet set the mode for the given resource. Now if you have NI-Serial 1.6 or higher installed with supported hardware, it will output the default configured state rather than <span class="Monospace">-1</span>. Otherwise, it will still output <span class="Monospace">-1</span>. Note that NI-Serial 1.6 does not implement this feature on all currently supported NI RS-485 controllers.</p>

<h3><a name="NI-VISA_3.1_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES" id="NI-VISA_3.1_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES">NI-VISA 3.1</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">NI-VISA 3.1 supports the PXI/PCI interface type in the RTX real-time environment in LabVIEW RT. This is a new feature.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The VISA Driver Development Wizard can install the generated INF file onto your local system. This is a new feature.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The BACKPLANE resource type is supported in the PXI resource class. This is a new feature.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a VI running on LabVIEW RT, calling VISA Close on an ENET-Serial resource would occasionally either hang or return an error. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viClose</span> on an Ethernet resource would leak a socket handle. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In MAX, it was not possible to create static TCPIP resources on a LabVIEW RT system. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">On Windows NT, 2000, or XP, calling <span class="Monospace">viEnableEvent</span> on a PXI/PCI INSTR resource would occasionally cause a system crash. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Reading data from a Serial port was slow. The performance has improved.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Using the <strong>Serial Break</strong> VI from LabVIEW did not work with remote NI-VISA. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Querying <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_ASRL_AVAIL_NUM</span> on a parallel port would return a large random number. The correct value for this is always 0. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you created a TCPIP resource in MAX with an alias, it would not show up. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In MAX, choosing the <strong>Tools&#0187;NI-VISA&#0187;VISA Options</strong> menu item would not always bring up the options. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In MAX, if you disabled a COM port and clicked <strong>Refresh</strong>, the Serial resource would disappear completely. This has been fixed. The resource now continues to exist but has a black <strong>X</strong> overlay icon to indicate that it is disabled.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The VISA Driver Development Wizard now supports the PXI standard <span class="Monospace">module.ini</span> format. It will generate that file along with the <span class="Monospace">.inf</span> files for NI-VISA. You can also use this wizard to load <span class="Monospace">module.ini</span> files from other vendors.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In MAX, if you inserted a new Serial port, it would erroneously claim that the settings have a conflict. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The <span class="Monospace">VI_EVENT_USB_INTR</span> event attributes did not work properly. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you unplugged a VISA USB device and plugged it back in, NI-VISA could not access the device properly. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viEnableEvent</span> on a remote VISA session would leak memory in the server. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Creating a new remote NI-VISA system would hang MAX. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The hostname <span class="Monospace">localhost</span> or the IP address <span class="Monospace">127.0.0.1</span> did not work properly with remote NI-VISA. Only the DHCP name or network IP address would work. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The remote NI-VISA server did not properly validate a hostname with an underscore. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viGetAttribute</span> on <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_INTF_INST_NAME</span> on TCPIP resources with Internet Explorer 2 would crash. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you enabled a LabVIEW RT system that was using DHCP as a VISA remote system to search when finding resources, NI-VISA would use the IP address rather than the DNS name. Starting with LabVIEW RT 7.1, remote systems are correctly assigned DNS names, and NI-VISA can use the DNS name when finding remote resources. Any existing remote VISA system that was enabled for finding will remain listed using its IP address unless you disable and re-enable the system for finding. Enabling a remote system with LabVIEW RT 7.1 already installed will result in NI-VISA using the DNS name if it is the same as the name of the remote controller. Otherwise, if the remote system is not using DHCP, or if the DNS name does not match the controller name, NI-VISA will still use the IP address of the remote system.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In MAX, if you changed the VISA Options and browsed to another item, your changes would sometimes be lost. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The manufacturer and model name for PXI/PCI resources were incorrectly reported as unknown. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The global attributes on a GPIB INTFC resource were not properly shared across sessions. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viOpen</span> on a remote NI-VISA resource did not honor the <span class="Monospace">openTimeout</span> parameter. This has been fixed.</p>

<h3><a name="NI-VISA_3.0.1_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES" id="NI-VISA_3.0.1_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES">NI-VISA 3.0.1</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">For a PXI INSTR resource, calling <span class="Monospace">viEnableEvent</span> and <span class="Monospace">viDisableEvent</span> in a loop would leak memory. On LabVIEW RT, this would eventually cause a reboot.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a GPIB INTFC resource, performing any asynchronous I/O would
occasionally cause a crash when you later close the VISA session.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Installing NI-VISA 3.0 on a system with LabVIEW 6.1 would cause user VIs that use <strong>VISA Configure Serial Port</strong> to have a broken wire.</p>

<h3><a name="NI-VISA_3.0_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES" id="NI-VISA_3.0_IMPROVEMENTS_AND_BUG_FIXES">NI-VISA 3.0</a></h3>

<p class="Indent1">The driver now works properly with Fast User Switching on Windows XP/2000.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a PXI INSTR resource, we now support PXI/PCI devices that rely on the subvendor ID and/or the subvendor model code. To use this functionality, you must create a new <span class="Monospace">.inf</span> file with the VISA Driver Development Wizard. The attributes <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_PXI_SUB_MANF_ID</span> and <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_PXI_SUB_MODEL_CODE</span> are no longer supported by the VISA driver. The correct attributes to query are now <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_MANF_ID</span> and <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_MODEL_CODE</span>. These will return the primary vendor information if no subvendor information is present, and they will return the subvendor information if it is present.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a PXI MEMACC resource, <span class="Monospace">viMemFree</span> now frees all memory correctly.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, <span class="Monospace">viOpen</span> on both Windows and LabVIEW RT will now accept <span class="Monospace">COMx</span> as a valid resource name even if MAX has not yet been run.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, <span class="Monospace">viOpen</span> will now open a port if the process that had been using that port exited ungracefully (such as with &lt;Ctrl-C&gt;). The previous behavior had been that <span class="Monospace">viOpen</span> would return <span class="Monospace">VI_ERROR_RSRC_BUSY</span>.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, <span class="Monospace">viWriteAsync</span> was not implemented. Now it is.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, multiple sessions to the same port caused weird behavior if you tried to both write and read data simultaneously. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, if you enabled RTS/CTS flow control and then manually tried to set the state of the RTS line, some operating systems would generate <span class="Monospace">VI_ERROR_NSUP_ATTR</span> while others would return <span class="Monospace">VI_SUCCESS</span> but not actually modify the state of the line. Neither of these behaviors was correct. Now NI-VISA will return <span class="Monospace">VI_ERROR_INV_SETUP</span> in this case on all operating systems.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, the RS-485 wire mode attribute now works properly on Windows XP/2000.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In GPIB, the attribute <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_INTF_INST_NAME</span> would report an unknown
board type for some GPIB-USB and GPIB-ENET controllers. The symptom was also visible in the VISA Interactive Control utility. This attribute now reports the correct information.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In GPIB, the implementation of <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> could take up to 10 s if you had NI-488.2 version 2.0 installed. The symptom was also visible in LabVIEW when you dropped the first VISA resource control on the front panel. This now takes less than 1 s on most machines.</p>

<p class="Indent1">NI Spy occasionally would incorrectly report an output jobID of 0 for <span class="Monospace">viReadAsync</span> or <span class="Monospace">viWriteAsync</span>, even though the operation completed successfully with a valid nonzero jobID.</p>

<p class="Indent1">NI Spy would not restore the window location on a monitor other than the primary monitor. This now works as expected.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you ran MAX as a guest user and edited the Passport settings, the new settings could not be saved to the registry, but MAX did not generate a warning. This has been fixed, and you will now get a warning.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a TCPIP SOCKET resource, <span class="Monospace">viReadAsync</span> was not implemented. Now it is.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The remote NI-VISA server could not be started on the same machine as the remote DAQ server because they both used the same port. Now the remote NI-VISA server uses port 3537 by default.</p>

<p class="Indent1"><span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> would crash on a complex expression with multiple <span class="Monospace">|</span> symbols. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you had a GPIB device at primary address 1 that generated a response to <span class="Monospace">*IDN?</span> that was longer than 100 characters, <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> would occasionally crash. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Some VISA COM components were not being correctly registered.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The VISA COM API would return an incorrect string from <span class="Monospace">ReadString</span> if the number of bytes read was exactly what was requested.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The VISA COM API would not return output string parameters correctly if the variable passed into the function was uninitialized or had a garbage value. This problem was normally only seen from C++ when using a raw <span class="Monospace">BSTR</span> instead of <span class="Monospace">CComBSTR</span>. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In GPIB, the implementation of <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> on LabVIEW RT would find GPIB
resources only on <span class="Monospace">GPIB0</span>. It now finds GPIB resources on any configured GPIB interface number.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viUnmapAddress</span> when using an Agilent HP-E1406A GPIB-VXI controller would cause the application to crash. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The attributes <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_MANF_NAME</span> and <span class="Monospace">VI_ATTR_MODEL_NAME</span> are now correctly implemented for GPIB-VXI regardless of whether NI-VXI is installed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The maximum simultaneous number of GPIB-VXI controllers supported by NI-VISA has changed from 10 to 32.</p>

<p class="Indent1">The VISA Driver Development Wizard (formerly known as the PXI Driver Development Wizard) now allows multiple logical-OR PXI interrupt conditions.</p>

<p class="Indent1">You can now edit the binding properties of a VISA TCPIP resource in MAX. For example, you can change the hostname or IP address.</p>

<p class="Indent1">MAX can now auto-detect VXI-11 TCPIP resources on your subnet. When you right-click on <strong>Devices and Interfaces</strong> and choose <strong>Create New...</strong>, you then need to specify a VXI-11 instrument and click the option to have MAX browse your local subnet.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you enabled the VISA COM API for <span class="Monospace">VI_EVENT_SERVICE_REQ</span> for a callback, it would crash when the event was being raised. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If you tried to exit the VISA Interactive Control utility by right-clicking on the taskbar icon and choosing <strong>Close</strong>, the utility would hang. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Using remote NI-VISA with asynchronous I/O did not properly transmit data asynchronously. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In Serial on LabVIEW RT, you can now configure advanced settings (such as FIFO triggers and the default RS-485 wire mode) in MAX.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In Serial, if the Windows configuration settings for a given port were different from the NI-VISA settings, MAX would overwrite the Windows settings when you clicked <strong>Refresh</strong>. Now, MAX points out the different settings and lets you choose.</p>

<p class="Indent1">In MAX, selecting <strong>Rename</strong> on an alias and changing merely the case of the alias would cause an error. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1">When calling <span class="Monospace">viWaitOnEvent</span> repeatedly with a timeout of 0 (immediate), some interfaces and event types would still consume excessive CPU time. Now doing this will yield the CPU regardless of the interface or event type.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a Serial INSTR resource, if a parity or framing error occurred, NI-VISA would not return the correct error condition. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class="Indent1"><span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> would return <span class="Monospace">VI_ERROR_INV_EXPR</span> if the expression exceeded 255 characters. Now it will accept resource expressions of any length.</p>

<p class="Indent1">If a PXI multifunction device did not have function 0 registered as an NI-VISA resource, <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> would not return any of the other functions of that device either, even if they were registered with NI-VISA. This now works properly.</p>

<p class="Indent1">Calling <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> would always assert REN on each GPIB board after finding devices. Now <span class="Monospace">viFindRsrc</span> will reassert REN on each board only if there is at least one open VISA INSTR session on that board.</p>

<p class="Indent1">For a TCPIP SOCKET resource, using <span class="Monospace">viRead</span> with <span class="Monospace">termchar</span> enabled was much slower than reading the exact number of bytes. The performance of using <span class="Monospace">termchar</span> with <span class="Monospace">viRead</span> is now much better than it was.</p>
